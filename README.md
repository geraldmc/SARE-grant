#### SARE Grant 

This repository contains runnable code in the form of iPython notebooks (under notebooks directory). It condenses work done between 2016-2018 in a hot sugarcane field in south Louisiana. The work was part of a USDA-funded study on the feasibility of using multi-spectral imagery, captured by quadcopter drone, to predict the yield of a sugarcane crop. The full report is located on the website of the Sustainable Agriculture and Research division of USDA, which is located [here](https://projects.sare.org/project-reports/fs14-282/). 

The full report on SARE's site is organized into twelve sections and collectively describes the background, motivation and results. This is a summary only. Here the focus is on code, how it works, and what I learned over the course of two long growing seasons about sugar cane, image data and agriculture.
