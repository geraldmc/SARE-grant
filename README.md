#### SARE Grant 

This repository contains runnable code in the form of iPython notebooks. It condenses a lot of work done between 2016-2018 in a hot sugarcane field in south Louisiana. The work was part of a USDA-funded study on the feasibility of using multi-spectral imagery, captured by quadcopter drone, to predict the yield of a sugarcane crop. The full report is located on the website of the Sustainable Agriculture and Research division of USDA, which is located [here](https://projects.sare.org/project-reports/fs14-282/). 

While the full report is organized into twelve sections and collectively describes the background, motivation and results of the study, this is a summary only. Here the focus is on the code, how it works, and in what I learned over the course of two growing seasons about sugar cane, image data and agriculture.
